MidweekPay Payday Loans

The Fairness in Lending Act balances the interests of borrowers and lenders to ensure widespread access to beneficial credit. Borrowers get at least three months to repay unless monthly payments are limited to 6 percent of the borrower’s gross monthly income. Lenders can charge up to 28 percent annual interest and a maximum monthly fee of 10 percent, capped at $30—meaning that a $400, three-month loan won’t cost more than $109. Before the law’s passage, the same loan would have cost a borrower more than three times that amount.
