While some consumer advocates maintain that payday loans should be banned altogether and every store shut down, this fair-minded law won’t do that. Instead, it is likely that there will be some consolidation of inefficient stores, while some lower-cost lenders enter the market to create much-needed competition.

Ohio lawmakers on both sides of the aisle addressed the problems of payday loans using a rigorous, evidence-based approach. As a result, borrowers will continue to have access to credit at much lower prices, and struggling families in Ohio will get some financial breathing room. They’ll have more money to spend at the grocery store, more to meet their kids’ needs, and more to help ensure reliable transportation.
